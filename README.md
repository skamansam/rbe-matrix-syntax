# RBE Matrix theme

NOTE: This theme is designed to be used with the [atom-material-ui UI theme](https://github.com/silvestreh/atom-material-ui) for Atom.

This theme is a basic bright green "Matrix"-like theme. However, this design incorporates some reds and blues to make
the syntax easier to digest at a  glance. I am mainly a Ruby on Rails developer, so I have tested this theme thoroughly
on ruby, html, haml, markdown, asciidoc, javascript, SQL, coffeescript, ECMAScript 6 (ES6), and JSON. I have included some
test files in the source code of this syntax plugin, as a test. These were taken from the [highlight.js](http://hightlightjs.org) web site.
